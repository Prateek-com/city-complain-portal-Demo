# City Complaint Portal – Demo

⚠️ **Note (Work in Progress)**

This repository is currently in the **early learning and setup phase**.

Some files like `index.css` and `main.tsx` are being uploaded **randomly for practice purposes**, to:
- understand GitHub workflow
- practice file structure
- test frontend setup
- keep the repository active during development

These files **do not represent the final structure or implementation** of the project.

The actual development will start step by step very soon, and files may be changed, removed, or reorganized at any time.

📌 This project is being built as a **college / learning project**, and improvements will be pushed gradually.
